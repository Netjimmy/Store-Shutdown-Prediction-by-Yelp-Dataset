We build a business failure model to predict if a business will survive another half-year. The data is from "The Yelp Dataset Challenge 2017". Collecting data from Yelp users, our model can come up with promising results (Kappa coefficient = 0.156) in business failure classification problems. In addition, PCA can further improve our performance by projecting our features into lower dimensions.
